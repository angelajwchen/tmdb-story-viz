## 📊 Dataset

**Source**: TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset  
**Time Range**: 1980-2015 (filtered from original 1916-2017 range)  
**Movies Analyzed**: ~4,800 films with complete budget/revenue data  

### Key Data Fields
- Financial metrics (budget, revenue, profit, ROI)
- Audience metrics (ratings, vote counts, popularity)
- Production details (genre, runtime, release date)
- Industry data (production companies, directors, stars)

## 🎯 Key Insights Revealed

### Scene 1: Financial Evolution
- Movie budgets increased by **340%** from 1980 to 2015
- The 2009 financial crisis caused a temporary dip in industry spending
- Average movie revenues grew by **280%** over the same period

### Scene 2: Genre Wars
- **Action** and **Adventure** films dominate box office revenues
- **Documentary** films achieve highest ratings but lowest budgets
- **Comedy** and **Drama** provide consistent, moderate returns

### Scene 3: Blockbuster Formula
- Movies with 90-120 minute runtimes show **15% higher profits**
- Top 1% of films generate **60%** of total industry profits
- Return on investment leaders are often low-budget horror/thriller films

   - Remove invalid entries (missing budget/revenue)
   - Parse numeric values and handle edge cases
   - Extract primary genre from multi-genre fields
3. **Data Transformation**:
   - Calculate derived metrics (profit, ROI, profit margin)
   - Group by year, genre, and decade
   - Generate summary statistics
4. **Data Validation**: Filter to 1980-2015 range with quality checks

## 🎨 Design System

### Color Palette
- **Primary Blue** (#1f77b4) - Financial/Budget data
- **Success Green** (#2ca02c) - Revenue/Positive outcomes  
- **Accent Orange** (#ff7f0e) - Profit/Performance metrics
- **Warning Red** (#d62728) - Losses/Negative indicators

### Typography
